### Hi there ðŸ‘‹.
 I'm a software engineer currently working as a frontend developer.


 I enjoy my weekends participating in programming competitions ðŸ¥‡ (most part of the time on  [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/KhozmoS)),
or playing some video games.


 ðŸš€ Open to work on interesting & challenging projects!
