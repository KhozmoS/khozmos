### Hi there 👋.
 I'm a 25 years old software engineer currently working as a frontend developer in [VLUE LLC](https://www.vlue.com).


 I enjoy my weekends participating in programming competitions 🥇 (most part of the time on  [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/KhozmoS)),
or playing some video games 🎮.


Checkout my [online resume](https://khozmos.github.io/khozmos-resume/) for detailed insights about me 🧐.


 🚀 Open to work on interesting & challenging projects!
