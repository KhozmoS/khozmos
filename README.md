### Hi there 👋.
 I'm a 25 years old software engineer currently working as frontend developer in [VLUE LLC](https://www.vlue.com).





 I enjoy my weekends participating in programming competitions 🥇 (most part of the time on  [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/KhozmoS)),
or playing some video games 🎮.





 🚀 Open to work in interesting & challenging projects!
